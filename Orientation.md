# Semiconductors, their importance, complexities and how its developed?

# Reducing form factor, increasing functionality, increased design complexity, increased necessity of knowledge transfer and skill development

# What keeps the semiconductor development rolling?

Cutting edge research
- New device structure --> paradigm shift from planar to 3D structures, finFETs, HEMTs
