### Should we increase complexity? 

<img width="1311" height="684" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 110259" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58de156b-8f7b-4115-a4e9-38ff7e80edfc" />

### Designing Planar MOSFET

What happens if we increases Na?
- Affects Qsd --> can tune Vt, body effect
- Increase electric field near drain --> early failure and reliability concerns

<img width="1435" height="426" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 111556" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d95bb64-37d9-4148-8eaa-0dec62fed401" />

Reducing Na
- Reduced field near drain edge
- Increased voltage drop in substrate --> false triggering of the parasitic BJT --> failure
- Punch through --> more promient in short channel devices
- Trade off between realiability and performance

### Should we try and increase complexity further?

- Non planar structure? FinFETs
 - The potential distribution, electric fields and carrier densities will have to be analyzed in 3-dimensions
 - Correlated design parameters --> simultaneous optimization --> exponentially increasing design time
- What happens when we integrate different materials?
 - Different band gap, different mobility formation of quantum well

### Is Understandiong Device Design Enough?

- Process challenges in fabricating modern-day devices
- The process limitation induced impact on device design
- The device design has to take into account the exact device structure
- Ion implementation the trade off between doping control, cost and crystal damage

### Device Simulator - DC, AC, Transient performance and reliability analysis, device circuit co-simulation

### TCAD - Technology Computer Aided Design

<img width="2601" height="1318" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 125851" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f9533b-c42b-4afe-abb0-7ffbf155bf26" />

What is process simulation?

- Virtual representation or simulation of the manufacturing process of semiconductor chips
  - focused on the smallest building blocks the individual transistor and their immediate environment

- Sentaurus Process
  - focused on doping implant and diffusion and oxidation
  - more phenomenological on etching and deposition

 - DOPING - locally doping the electrical properties of the semiconductor
 - IMPLANTING - "shooting" ions the semiconductor
 - DIFFUSION / ANNEALING - heat treatment to drive the ions in deeper, activate them, and to heal damage
 - OXIDATION - turning a semiconductor into an insulator
 - ETCHING - removing material with either reactive ions or solvents
 - DEPOSITION - growing material typical from compounds in the gas environment
 - MASKING - using the layout like a masking tape to expose or protect certain area
Process flow description are input to process simulation

### Ion Implantation

- Ion implantation into on axis crystals leads to many ions experiencing small angle scattering and channel deep into the crystal
- Their stopping is then dominated by electronic drag only, which results in a channeling tail
- The resultant profile is described by a "dual - pearson distribution"

Tilting the wafer reduces channeling

<img width="726" height="578" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 133841" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da846d5f-42f3-408c-9ce9-6b292cc6def8" />

Implantation through a thin oxide also reduces channeling

### Diffusion

- Diffusion is modelled either modelled atomistic or in a continum with a set of partial differential equation

<img width="878" height="430" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 134555" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fbc3adf-ffb7-47b3-8857-acd4bb8ac6b2" />

In the kick out mechanisms, self interstitials kick out substitutional dopants
<img width="1299" height="695" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 134505" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0757aa-dae3-42c4-8cc9-9d4db133bdd0" />


In the frank mechanisms, interstitial dopants or dopant interstiatial pairs occupy vacant sites and become substitutional dopants
