### Semiconductors, their importance, complexities and how its developed?

### Reducing form factor, increasing functionality, increased design complexity, increased necessity of knowledge transfer and skill development

### What keeps the semiconductor development rolling?

Cutting edge research
- New device structure --> paradigm shift from planar to 3D structures, finFETs, HEMTs
- New materials integrations, like strained Si:Ge for enhanced mobility, shifting to wide band gap semiconductors like GaN, SiC, Diamond
- Moving to 2D and even single atom devices

Reliability improvements through innovation
Improved understanding of physical mechanisms
Bringing down cost of research, development and production

### Understanding Device Design

### A step ahead - designing of a diode

### Design seems complex?
Recombination current at lower forward biases

### Should we increase complexity? 

### Designing Planar MOSFET

What happens if we increases Na?
- Affects Qsd --> can tune Vt, body effect
- Increase electric field near drain --> early failure and reliability concerns

Reducing Na
- Reduced field near drain edge
- Increased voltage drop in substrate --> false triggering of the parasitic BJT --> failure
- Punch through --> more promient in short channel devices
- Trade off between realiability and performance

### Designing Planar MOSFET

### Should we try and increase complexity further?

- Non planar structure? FinFETs
 - The potential distribution, electric fields and carrier densities will have to be analyzed in 3-dimensions
 - Correlated design parameters --> simultaneous optimization --> exponentially increasing design time
- What happens when we integrate different materials?
 - Different band gap, different mobility formation of quantum well

### Is Understandiong Device Design Enough?
