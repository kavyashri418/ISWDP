# Introduction to Semiconductor Devices

## How to analyze any Semiconductor Device?
- Primary steps required to translate a device from textbook or idea to a TCAD simulation
- Start with intrinsic and extrinsic silicon bar, p-n junction diode and then proceed towards transistors
- First step in learning devices and their simulation

## Energy bands of materials

Large Eg prohibits thermally excited electrons from moving to the conduction band

## What are Semiconductors
- Conductivity lies between that to insulators and conductors.
- Distinguish through band gap.
- Silicon (Group IV elemen) is widely used.
- Doping is used to modulate the conductivity
  - N-type dopant (V) electrons are the majority carriers
  - P-type dopant (III) holes are the majority carriers

## How does the carrier concentration vary with Temperature

Case I: T = 0K

<img width="1765" height="837" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 095733" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf81937-87cf-40ec-95e3-accb405b563b" />

No extrinsic carriers due to doping, and no intrinsic carriers due to thermal excitation across the band gap.

Case II: T > 0K (Low Temperature)

<img width="1736" height="808" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 100832" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ab43e3-9b7b-442e-aa06-eb14b042d8ea" />

A few extrinsic carriers due to doping, but no intrinsic carriers due to thermal excitation across the band gap.

Case III: T = 300K

<img width="1758" height="827" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 100913" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c522292-2cdc-4da8-ae15-46f1a44d4fbe" />

Many extrinsic carriers due to doping, but very few intrinsic carriers due to thermal excitation across the band gap.

Case IV: T >> 300K (High Temperature)

Extrinsic carriers due to doping, but also many intrinsic carriers due to thermal excitation across the band gap also many holes in the valence band now.

## Fermi-Level for Extrinsic Semiconductor

Fermi-Level (Ef) = average energy of electrons in a material, the fermi-dirac distribution, f(E) gives the probability that a state having energy E is occupied by an electron

## How current flows through the semiconductor?
Current density J = œÉE
- E = applied electric field
- œÉ = conductivity
- q = electronic charge
- n = electron / hole density
- ùúá = mobility

## Mobility vs Doping

## Ionized Impurity Scattering

Donors provide electrons to the conduction band but ionized donors can "scatter" those electrons
Analyzing a Si semiconductor bar œÉ = qnùúá
- n = free carrier mobility

How can we increase the current for a given voltages?
Increase conductivity, increase ùúá or n
Increase n will reduce mobility less promient increase in current

Note - These relations and a linear increase in current holds only for low electric field

## What is Mobility?
- In the world of semiconductor devices, electron mobility plays a crucial role.
- It refers to the speed at which an electron moves through a material when subjected to an electric field.
- The lighter the mobility of electrons in a material the faster they can move, and the faster the device can operate.
- This makes it an important factor in the design of electronic devices as it affects their speed, power consumption.

## Velocity and Electric field

## Understanding the complexities of physical models

Case I: A lower node current as compared to electron current.

Case II: Everything looks prefect we can visualize the impact of n on mobility and current.

What happens at high electric fields to velocity saturation effect
Current should have saturated doesnot happen 
Physics section and the operator's understanding of device physics is critical.
